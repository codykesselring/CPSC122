For this programming assignment, we are going to work with doubly linked lists, queues, and prime numbers! You are going to implement a class called Sieve (Sieve.h and Sieve.cpp) that computes all the primes up to some integer n. The technique you are to use was developed by a Greek named Eratosthenes who lived in the third century BC. The technique is known as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

Example Run
This program computes all prime numbers up to a maximum using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

Please enter n, where n is max value to show primes up to and including (-1 to quit): 20
Primes up to 20 are as follows: 
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 
8 / 20 = 40% primes

Please enter n, where n is max value to show primes up to and including (-1 to quit): 100
Primes up to 100 are as follows: 
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97 
25 / 100 = 25% primes

Please enter n, where n is max value to show primes up to and including (-1 to quit): -1
